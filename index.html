Sweetheart,

This small little token gift is just something small to convey the sheer and utter love I have for you and to make you feel even an ounce, a drop, a single atom extra special and loved than usual.

I know right now you're going through a hard time with your shark week, meaning slightly more emotional, and I want you to know from the bottom of my heart to yours that I'm here for you to support you and take care of you and reassure you and your doubts or anything else that plagues you this week.

I will always always always be here for you sweetie no matter whatâ€”through the good times and the badâ€”I will always be here when you need me, no matter what, because I want you to know that I am a man you can rely on and someone you can trust in to help pick you up, dust you off, and hold your hand while you regain your footing.

I will always be here for you even now in these moments where I can't physically be by your side. I will always always be with you in spirit, and when you need me I am just a call away.

Getting to not only know you, my dear, but to become part of your life, to become entangled in it and enjoy every single day with you has become an absolute dream. Every second of it I wouldn't trade for all the riches in the world.

Getting to hear your voice. Getting to see you. Those are the moments my heart jumpsâ€”your little mannerisms, the little to-you totally accidental or unknowable quirks that you have, that you've dismissed as everyday thingsâ€”that I get to see or hear and just bask in. Each one of them makes my heart dance as those are the little, forgettable-to-you and memorable-to-me, extremely cute things that just make me smile and want to run and kiss you and hug you and just make me wanna say "Wowwww that's the girl that loves me?"

You're a beautiful star, you really are. You shine so so so bright and I'm so lucky that I'm the man who gets to bask in that glow. You are amazingâ€”every little thing that you do just sets my heart on fire and makes me thank fate to be blessed with someone so caring, kind, reassuring, understanding, generous, forgiving, and lovingâ€”that I really must have won the lottery to have a soulmate this perfect.

You, every day in some magical way, make me feel so loved, reassured, and secure. Honestly, the fact that nobody else has seen what I see so far is one of the greatest tragedies of the world in my opinion, since you just shine so so so bright.

I constantly just wanna make you feel so so so secure, protected, safe, cared for, looked after, worried about, cherished, admired, respected, adored, and above all, loved. Not a day will go by where I don't try to be a better man because you deserve the best man, and every single day I'm gonna make the effort to become that guy that you deserve.

Love can be a scary thing. It can be a terrifying, brutal, scary thing that hurts you. So to have you put so much love in me, invest so much in us and open up so so so much to me and trust meâ€”when all your past experiences, including the ones you haven't told me about, have told you the oppositeâ€”it just means the world to me. It really really does.

I can't express in words how dearly I love you. I lack the rhyme or the wit or the words or the poetic talent to convey it. But I love you more and more each day and the love I have for you is the deepest of oceansâ€”it really is.

Every single day I am so grateful to have you in my life and the love you give me. Every day all I can think about is how much you mean to me and our future together. The future you know I'm gonna make work because all I wanna be in life is the man who gets to be with you and love youâ€”that's all I want. I don't care what I have to do, I will move mountains to make it work because you know I'd do anything for you.

I love every second with you and wanna be the man who gets to give you all his time, spend time with you every single day, and who gets to walk through life, hand in hand with you by his side.

What I guess I'm trying to say is above allâ€”above all these words and rhetoricâ€”is that,

I love you sweetie, my wifey, my girlfriend. I love you so so so so so so so so so so much.

Love,
Your boyfriend,
Jonathan
